# (IMDB movies database)

## Dataset


> This data set contains information
about 10,000 movies collected from
The Movie Database (TMDb),
including user ratings and revenue.
● Certain columns, like ‘cast’
and ‘genres’, contain multiple
values separated by pipe (|)
characters.
● There are some odd characters
in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry
about cleaning them. You can
leave them as is.
● The final two columns ending
with “_adj” show the budget and
revenue of the associated movie
in terms of 2010 dollars,
accounting for inflation over
time

## Summary of Findings

In this notebook I will be investogating a dataset of IMD movies to answer two questions which are:
 1.  Do the best rated movies have higher profits?
 2.  Do movies with higher budgets ger better ratings?
To accomplish this I will be performing a number of tasks which are: 
- cleaning the datasets - this will include droping unwanted information , checking for duplicates, renaming some columns if need be etc. 
- Exploration - I will then proceed to exploring the data looking for clues which will help me asnwer certain questings which we wouls see later in the notebook. 
- Finally I will give my conclusion based on all my finding
